# employee-tracker

# Purpose

Our task this week was to build an employee tracker using the command line and technologies such as Node.js, SQL and Inquirer. Users are able to manage their emlpoyee database by answering command-line questions that allows them to view departments, roles and emlpoyees, as well as add departments, roles and employees. Users can also update an employees role.
